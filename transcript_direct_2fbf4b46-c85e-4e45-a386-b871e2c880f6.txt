User (LLM): What is PrEP and how does it work?
CHIA: PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a medication taken by individuals who are at high risk of HIV to prevent infection. It works by maintaining a certain level of the drug in your bloodstream, which helps stop the virus from establishing an infection if you're exposed. It's a powerful tool for prevention, especially when combined with other strategies like regular STI testing and reducing the number of partners. How do you feel about exploring PrEP as an option for your HIV prevention strategy?
